For this enhancement, I decided on the Travlr project, specifically the administrative dashboard used for managing trips. The artifact is a full-stack web app first built in CS-465, designed to deliver both a backend API and a frontend Angular interface for travel management. The project was originally created earlier in the degree program and has been refined since then. I chose this artifact for my ePortfolio because it shows key areas of software development: building a backend API, securing authentication with JSON Web Tokens, and creating a functional Angular user interface. These pieces show my ability to connect secure backend services with a usable frontend, demonstrating both design and engineering skills. The updates included aligning API usage with MongoDB, securing write operations with JWTs in environment variables, improving error handling with standardized JSON responses, and redesigning the Angular admin UI for a smoother and more polished look. Replacing location.reload() with this.reload() made the experience better by refreshing data without reloading the whole page, and adding a buildPayload() function ensured data was validated and formatted before being sent. 

With these improvements, I met the course outcome I set in Module One: applying software design and engineering principles to enhance an existing artifact. My approach stayed consistent, and these updates now show stronger alignment with best practices for secure, maintainable, and user-friendly software design. 

Looking back I learned how important consistent data handling is across both the backend and frontend. Converting dates into ISO format, trimming user input, and handling missing IDs highlighted the importance of payload validation for real-world maintainability. I also recognized the value of moving configuration details like MONGO_URI and JWT_SECRET into environment variables instead of hardcoding them. One challenge was dealing with older trips that lacked IDs, which I solved by providing clear user messages instead of failing silently. Another challenge was making sure the Angular UI gave immediate feedback after updates without needing a full page reload. The enhancement process improved both the app and my confidence in debugging full-stack issues while applying industry standards in security and user experience.
