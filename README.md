The product I selected from this category is the Travlr Getaways admin panel, a full-stack web application built with Angular, Node/Express, and MongoDB. This app was first created as coursework and has been refined over time throughout my program. The main focus of this update was improving the use of algorithms and data structures to make the application more efficient and scalable. The work included adding server-side sorting, filtering, and paging, along with client-side improvements like debounced search, request cancellation with RxJS, and using Sets and Maps for quicker lookups and data handling. 

I included this project in my ePortfolio because it shows my ability to apply algorithmic thinking and data structure knowledge in a real-world project. By moving away from simple list scans and full dataset loads, I was able to show that the application could scale efficiently as the data grew. Pagination, sorting, and caching highlight my skills in structuring queries and handling results, while the debounced search and RxJS work show that I can manage async operations and improve client-side performance. These updates demonstrate not only technical ability but also how system design can directly improve user experience. 

This enhancement aligns with the outcomes I set back in Module One specifically, using algorithms and data structures to improve efficiency and scalability in software systems. I didn’t need to change my original plan since the work directly covered those outcomes. 

Through this process, I learned important lessons about balancing backend and frontend responsibilities when working with data. On the backend, I saw how critical it is to enforce limits on queries to protect resources, while on the frontend, managing state properly helps avoid unnecessary network calls. One challenge I ran into was making caching with ETags work correctly and integrate smoothly with Angular’s request logic. Another was structuring Angular components so pagination and debounced search worked together without causing stale or overlapping requests. Working through these challenges gave me a stronger understanding of asynchronous programming and how client and server performance depend on each other.

Throughout my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science program, I’ve built a foundation in both the theory and practice of computing. The courses and projects challenged me to think critically in different ways, while applying my technical knowledge to real-world situations, and grow into an IT professional capable of designing, building, and maintaining complex systems. The capstone project brought all of these skills together, allowing me to deliver a full-stack, data driven web application that reflects my technical abilities and professional growth. 

My capstone experience gave me the chance to expand on previous work, turning it into a more complete product. The project I selected, the Travlr Getaways web application, highlights my ability to design, develop, and deploy secure software using technologies like MongoDB, Express, Angular, and Node.js. Through this work, I integrated front-end and back-end features, implemented secure authentication, improved database performance, and optimized data handling using efficient algorithms. Every enhancement requires a balance of analysis, creativity, and problem-solving skills that are importantfor any professional developer today. 

Beyond the technical side, this program helped me grow as a communicator and collaborator. I learned how to work effectively on multi-level projects, document my work clearly, and think strategically about software from design to deployment. Courses in network administration, cybersecurity, and cloud computing gave me a broader view of how systems connect and function as part of larger infrastructures. These experiences have shaped my career interests toward system and network administration, full-stack development, and cloud infrastructure management. 

This ePortfolio shows my progress as a computer scientist and problem solver. Each artifact highlights a key area of strength, from software design and database management to algorithmic efficiency. Together, they demonstrate my ability to apply computer science principles to real-world challenges. I’ve learned the importance of testing, documentation, and continuous improvement in building reliable and scalable solutions. This program has prepared me to confidently step into the tech industry, ready to contribute to the evolving world of computer science.
